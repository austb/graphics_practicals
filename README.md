# Jupiter Lander

Author - Austin Blatt

## Features

1. Rocket science - W, A, D keys
1. Tilt
1. Dense atmosphere
1. Orthocam
1. Afterburner
1. Exhaust plasma
1. Lucy in the sky (requires Orthocam)
1. Great balls of fire (requires Orthocam) - after implementing BOOM! 
   it did not make sense to have lander "lives" so the lander dies on collision with a fireball
1. Platforms
1. Landing strip - Lander must be upright and moving a bit slower than terminal velocity to land.
1. BOOM!
1. Jovians - Jovians are affected by gravity and are stopped via collision with the platform!
1. Minimap


## Additional Features

While on a platform, the player is surrounded by a shield, which will protect
the lander from fireballs (which explode with the BOOM! animation instead of killing
the player), and prevent the player from collecting diamonds.
Moving the lander with W, A, or D will imediately remove the shield.
