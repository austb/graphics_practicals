# A venture into 3D graphics

Physics with collisions - collisions with the ground only

Illumination - one directional and many point light sources illuminate the scene

Sky - displays a sky environment map

Environment mapping - mapped onto trees and "light posts"

Rotating parts - the helicopter has 2 rotors

Frenet frame (assumes airborne avatar) - yes, implemented

Helicam - yes, distance kept exactly constant

Plane-projected shadows - shadow of the helicopter (and its rotors) projected onto the groun

Procedural texturing - the ground plane is procedurally textured to look like sand

Procedural normal mapping - the "light posts" have been warped via procedural normal mapping
